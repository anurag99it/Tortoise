# Tortoise
assignment tortoise crossing problem
Tortoise is crawling on cartesian plane, it's path is described by array of integers [1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 2, â€¦], after each segment tortoise turns on 90 degrees clockwise. 
Find when the turtle crosses its own path and return the segment number. 

my approach is to 
-store every coordinate that turtle crosses and 
-compare every new coordinate that tutle comes on with the previous stored one's and
-if they coincide then we say that it crosses its own path.
